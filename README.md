XWorm V5.6 Cracked is a remote access trojan (RAT) that is sold as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS). It is a modular malware, meaning that it can be customized to perform a variety of malicious tasks, such as:

    Stealing sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and cryptocurrency wallets
    Launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
    Deploying ransomware
    Hijacking MetaMask and Telegram accounts
    Tracking user activity

XWorm is typically delivered to victims’ computers through phishing emails or malicious attachments. Once installed, it will establish persistence on the system and contact its command and control (C2) server. The C2 server can then be used by the attacker to remotely control the infected computer and execute malicious commands.
